# YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator

This project is an experiment to explore AI capabilities. The project is a YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator that calculates the total duration of a YouTube playlist based on specified playback speed and break settings.

The entire application was created using AI tools, demonstrating how AI can rapidly assist in developing functional applications from concept to completion.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to explore AI's capabilities in assisting with application development, from UI design to backend logic, with minimal manual coding effort.

## Development Process

1. **AI Tools Used**:

   - **Bolt.new**: Initially used for AI-assisted coding until the free token was exhausted.
   - **Cursor AI Editor**: Used for UI improvements after transitioning from Bolt.new.
   - **Preplexity AI**: Generated prompts for Bolt.new, assisting in feature development for this app.

2. **No Manual Coding**:
   - All code in this project is generated by AI. I didn’t write any code myself, allowing me to build the app in less than an hour, focusing on refining AI prompts and harnessing AI-powered tools.

## Features

- **Calculate Playlist Duration**: Enter a YouTube playlist link to calculate the total duration based on custom playback speed.
- **Custom Playback Speed**: Adjust the playback speed to see how it impacts total time.
- **Break Settings**: Include breaks between videos if desired.

## Motivation

I’ve always wanted to build a tool like this, but I couldn’t find the time to complete it. So, I decided to give Bolt.new a try and created this app with AI’s help.

This README was also created by an AI, ChatGPT.
