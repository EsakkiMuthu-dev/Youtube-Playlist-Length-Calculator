# YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator

This project is an AI-driven tool to calculate the total duration of a YouTube playlist based on specified playback speed and break settings. The entire application is created using AI tools, showcasing the potential of AI in rapid app development.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to explore AI's capabilities in assisting with application development, from UI design to backend logic, with minimal manual coding effort.

## Development Process

1. **AI Tools Used**:

   - **Bolt.new**: Initially used for AI-assisted coding until the free token was exhausted.
   - **Cursor AI Editor**: Used for UI improvements after transitioning from Bolt.new.
   - **Preplecity AI**: Generated prompts for Bolt.new, assisting in feature development for this app.

2. **No Manual Coding**:
   - All code in this project is generated by AI. I didn’t write any code myself, allowing me to build the app in less than an hour, focusing on refining AI prompts and harnessing AI-powered tools.

## Features

- **Calculate Playlist Duration**: Enter a YouTube playlist link to calculate the total duration based on custom playback speed.
- **Custom Playback Speed**: Adjust the playback speed to see how it impacts total time.
- **Break Settings**: Include breaks between videos if desired.

## Motivation

I’ve always wanted to build a tool like this but couldn’t complete it on my own before. This time, with the help of AI, I managed to create a functional app quickly and effectively, validating the power of AI in simplifying the coding process.
